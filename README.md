# Machine Learning From Scratch
This repository contains several popular machine learning algorithms built "from scratch" i.e. only using numpy, no machine learning libraries allowed.
<br><br>
The directory for each model provides a README explaining the model's purpose, underlying mathematics, and implementation to help shine a light on its innerworkings for anyone who is curious.
